Javascript flashcards

The technology used: bootstrap and jquery

bootstrap used for the buttons and the titles.

landing page, takes a name and email address which is then stored in local storage.

On the begin button click the current content is hidden and the study, practice, and test options pop up.

on click of these options a difficulty menu pops up with categories. When these are moused over a difficulty menu displays and disappers after the mouse hover off. 

When a difficulty option is selected the current content will disappear and a flashcard with an area of study/practice/test will display. 

Creating functions to automate the flashcard creation was a great learning experience, and the most challenging.

I got a deeper understanding of the jquery event/handler process. The hover event in particlar.

Some things that I'd like to add, are actual category problems to study/practice/test. With added functionality for practice and test.
